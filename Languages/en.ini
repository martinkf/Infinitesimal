HowToPlayBody2=If a long arrow is coming up, step and hold it down until the end of it!\n\nDon't let go of it, as you will get misses on every song beat!
HowToPlayBody3=If arrows go past the grey arrow targets, your life meter will deplete and your score will decrease.\n\nThis is especially important for long arrows, as they can give many misses quickly!
